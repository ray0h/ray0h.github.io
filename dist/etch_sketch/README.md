# The Odin Project Etch a Sketch Project

DOM Manipulation using vanilla JS. 

Link to the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav).

Taking this **opportunity** to ~~learn~~ and practice _markdown_ as well.  

One key takeaway was understanding how the different hooks return different objects and considering how to handle and manipulate the elements that are returned:

+ `element.getElementById` will return a single element that can easily be manipulated.  The ID only has to be in quotes.  

+ `element.querySelectorAll` requrires the prefix designating it as a id(#) or class(.) and will return a Nodelist

 + `element.getElementsByClassName` only has to be in quotes and returns an HTML collection.  This did not work as well for this exercise for reasons that must be considered further.
